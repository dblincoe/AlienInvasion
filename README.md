Rand Invasion
==============
This game was built upon cykod's Alien Invasion.

The game was changed to allow for increased functionality and a better playing experience.

The game was also modified to also fit the standards of Rand Paul's 2016 Presidential Campaign.

This is implemented as an "Easter Egg" in Rand Paul's 2016 Presidental Campaign.

It is released under both the GPL and MIT license to do with what you will.
